# Functional Effects

^ Let's talk about functional effects. As functional programmers we appreciate the benefits of programming only with functions and immutable values 

FP: Programming with values and functions

---
[.autoscale: false]
# Functional Effects
^ for example let's consider a Matrix (value) and a function for adding 2 matrices. This function is defined for every possible pair of matrices, this means the function `add` is a TOTAL function

FP: Programming with values and functions


[.code-highlight: 1-4]
[.code-highlight: 1-6]
[.code-highlight: 1-9]

```scala
case class Matrix(
  x11: Double, x12: Double, 
  x21: Double, x22: Double
)

def add(m1: Matrix, m2: Matrix): Matrix = ???

add(Matrix(1, 2, 3, 4), Matrix(5, 6, 7, 8)) 
// Matrix(6, 8, 10, 12)
```

---
[.autoscale: false]

# Functional Effects
^ Now let's consider another function, that given a matrix, inverts it

FP: Programming with values and functions

[.code-highlight: 1]
[.code-highlight: 1-5]
[.code-highlight: 1-7]

```scala
def invert(m: Matrix): Matrix = ???
val m = Matrix( 
    1, 2, 
    1, 2
)

invert(m) // Exception!
```

---
[.autoscale: false]

# Functional Effects
^ `invert` is clearly not a total function

`invert` is not a total function

[.code-highlight: 1]
[.code-highlight: 1-6]
```scala
def invert(m: Matrix): Option[Matrix] = ???
invert(
  Matrix(
    1, 2,
    1, 2)
  ) // None
```

^ What is a functional effect? It is a data structure, plus some operations, to deal with a concern.
E.g. if our concern is to express the presence or absence of a value, a functional effect we are using daily is `Option[A]`
If our concern is expressing the success (producing a value of type A) vs a failure (producing an error of type E) of an operation we can use `Either[E,A]` 

# Functional Effects

Given a concern, build _**an immutable data structure**_ that provides a set of operations to deal with that concern[^1]

[.code-highlight: none]
[.code-highlight: 1]
[.code-highlight: 1-2]
```scala
Option[A] 
Either[E, A]  
```

# Functional Effects
^ What do we do with these data structures? We can combine them (map, flatmap, zip), but ultimately we want to produce some workable value for our business case. Usually we us pattern matching, but we'd better get used to `fold`.
The interpretation phase takes these data structures, and extract the information and makes it usable

Interpretation: Produce some outcome from the processing of these data structures

[.code-highlight: 1]
[.code-highlight: 1-2]
[.code-highlight: 1-4]
[.code-highlight: 1-5]
```scala
val oa: Option[A]    
val res: B = oa.fold[B](ifEmpty)(a => ifNonEmpty) 

val ea: Either[E, A] 
val res: B = ea.fold[B](e => ifError)(a => ifSuccess)
```

# Functional Effects
^ Let's talk about one of my favourite hobbies. Baking bread. How do I express the act of baking, in an imperative way? 
I just give a list of instructions and they get immediately executed
How do we deal with this in a functional way? We separate the description from the execution

# Functional Effects
^ How do we deal with this in a functional way? We separate the description from the execution, having a data type that _describes_ what we want to do
Then we provide this data type with (pretty standard) mechanism to chain/transform the computation, classical `map`/`flatMap`

# Functional Effects

It _traverses_ the data structure, or our recipe, and executes the instructions written on those data structures

^ The second concern we need to deal with is the one of capabilities. What do I need in order to be able to knead my bread? What do I need to be able to cook it?
* ZIO[R, E, A] is an immutable data structure that expresses the concern of running a computation that might produce a value A, or fail with an error E, and requires a set of capabilities `R` in order to run
* So I define the methods in terms of the capabilities and then I chain them through the monadic operators. Notice that the contravariance in `R` is all the compiler need to do the `with` between environments

# Functional Effects
^ZIO effects must be interpreted, before that point they are just simple data structures. Default runtime environemnt can cope with effects that require standard JVM capabilities (console, random, system, clock and blocking), but if we have an effect that has richer requirements we must satisfy those requirements before running it.
So we provide our bread baking instructions with all the requirements they have, and finally we are able to interpret our data structure and get our bread.
The problem with this is that it's not immediate (not to me at least) how to make non-trivial applications, in a layered way, with dependencies of layer upon layer, or even with circular dependencies?

#### Provide and run

  val bread: ZIO[OvenEnv with WarmRoomEnv with MixerEnv, BakingError, Bread] = ???

  val r: ZIO[Any, BakingError, Bread] = bread.provide(new OvenEnv with WarmRoomEnv with MixerEnv)
  
  val result:Bread = runtime.unsafeRun(bread)
```

- Nice, but how do we deal with non-trivial applications?

# Environmental effects
^ What are environmental effects? They are functional effects (= immutable data structures) that model, at once, the requirement of an environment, the possibility to fail or succeed, and the possiblity to perform IO
This simple data type allows us to express different things: 
1. The introduction of an environment requirement. I can access the mixing machine together with the oven through that R

    ZIO.accessM { mixerEnv =>
      mixerEnv.mixingMachine.knead
    }

# Environmental effects
^ And then, later (typically close to the main program, or in testing) I can provide the environment that my functional effect needs, eliminating the requirement of that environment

  val dough: Dough = runtime.unsafeRun(autonomousEffect)
```

---

# Environmental effects
^ How do we mix these capabilities and error together? The simplest thing we can do is just flatmap these structures 

![left fit](img/bread.jpg) 

#### Functional baking

Chaining errors and capabilities

```scala
  val knead:               ZIO[MixerEnv, WrongIngredients, Dough]
  val raise(dough: Dough): ZIO[WarmRoomEnv, Nothing, Dough]
  val cook(dough: Dough):  ZIO[OvenEnv, Overcooking, Bread]

  val bakeBread = for {
    d1 <- knead
    d2 <- raise(d1)
    b  <- cook(d2)
  } yield b 
```

---

# Environmental effects
^ Not only ths works, but the compiler infers errors and environment for us
We can see that the act of chaining these operations makes the required capabilities mix into an intersection type between
the capabilities (`type BakingEnv = MixerEnv with WarmRoomEnv with OvenEnv`), and it tries to unify the errors, looking for the nearest common supertype of errors, in our case `BakingError`

#### Functional baking

Chaining errors and capabilities

```scala
  val knead:               ZIO[MixerEnv, WrongIngredients, Dough]
  val raise(dough: Dough): ZIO[WarmRoomEnv, Nothing, Dough]
  val cook(dough: Dough):  ZIO[OvenEnv, Overcooking, Bread]

  type BakingEnv = MixerEnv with WarmRoomEnv with OvenEnv
  
  val bakeBread: ZIO[BakingEnv, BakingError, Bread] = for {
    d1 <- knead
    d2 <- raise(d1)
    b  <- cook(d2)

- Vectors are column matrices with 0 as 4th element
`Vec(x, y, z)`  $$ \Rightarrow [x, y, z, 0]^T$$ 

- Points are column matrices with 1 as 4th element
`Pt(x, y, z)`  $$ \Rightarrow [x, y, z, 1]^T$$

- `rotate_z(pi/2, Vec(x, y, z))`

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \pi/2 & -\sin \pi/2 & 0 & 0\\
\sin \pi/2 & \cos \pi/2 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y\\
z \\
0\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- Same for all the other transformations

^It turns out that all we need for this, is matrices 4x4 and matrix product

^Enough of theory, let's build this. Let's start defining our matrix data type
The whole type is quite heavy to digest, so to forgive ourselves for the definition of such an abominion, we'll refer to matrix just as `M`
# Matrix Module

Matrix 

```scala
sealed abstract case class Matrix private (m: Int, n: Int, rows: Chunk[Chunk[Double]]) {
  def get(i: Int, j: Int): IO[IndexExceedMatrixDimension, Double] //ZIO[Any, ...]
  //... transpose etc
}

object Matrix {
 def fromRows(m: Int, n: Int, rows: L[L[Double]]): IO[MatrixConstructionError, Matrix[L]]
}

type M = Matrix
```

---

^Now let's define the operations we want to perform on matrices. These represent capabilities that are progressively required in our application,
so we model them through the module pattern. Module pattern provides a nice namespace separation between different capabilities that might be required
That namespace is in the `val` in the trait
# Matrix Module

Operations on matrix

[.code-highlight: 1,3]
[.code-highlight: 1, 3, 5-12]
[.code-highlight: 1-12]
```scala
trait MatrixModule {
  val matrixModule: MatrixModule.Service[Any]
}

object MatrixModule {
  trait Service[R] {
    def add(m1: M, m2: M): ZIO[R, AlgebraicError, M]
    def mul(m1: M, m2: M): ZIO[R, AlgebraicError, M]
    def invert(m: M): ZIO[R, AlgebraicError, M]
    //... a few others
  }
}
```

---


^We can define a live implementation of our module, that delegates to Breeze the matrix operations
# Matrix Module

Live implementation (backed by Breeze)

```scala
trait MatrixModule {
  val matrixModule: MatrixModule.Service[Any]
}

object MatrixModule {
  trait BreezeMatrixModule extends MatrixModule {
    import breeze.linalg._
    override val matrixModule: Service[Any] = new Service[Any] {
      def invert(m: M): ZIO[Any, AlgebraicError, M] = for {
         //... 
        bm            <- ZIO.effectTotal(DenseMatrix.create(nrRows, nrCols, arrayElems))
        breezeInverse <- ZIO.effect(inv(bm)).mapError(_ => AlgebraicError.MatrixNotInvertible)
        res           <- M.create(breezeInverse)
      } yield res  
    }
  }
}
```

---
# Matrix Module

Recap:

- We defined a module with the definition of the capabilities to operate on matrices
- We provided an implementation of that service backed by Breeze
- We can define as many implementations as we want
 
---
^ Now that we have capability of operating on matrices (of any size), next step is to work with our 4 x 4 matrices to implement our transformatiosn
So we define an affine transformation data type, that we require to travel along with its inverse, for efficiency reasons
And then we define the module for affine transformations
The convention that makes everything work smooth, is to name your service instance in the module just like the module, with first letter lower case

^ Now that we have capability of operating on matrices (of any size), next step is to work with our 4 x 4 matrices to implement our transformatiosn
So we define an affine transformation data type, that we require to travel along with its inverse, for efficiency reasons
And then we define the module for affine transformations
# Affine transformations module

- Live implementation

```scala
  trait Live extends ATModule {
    val matrixModule: MatrixModule.Service[Any]

    val aTModule: ATModule.Service[Any] = new ATModule.Service[Any] {
      override def applyTf(tf: AT, vec: Vec): ZIO[Any, AlgebraicError, Vec] =
        for {
          col    <- toCol(vec)
          colRes <- matrixModule.mul(tf.direct, v) // case class AT(direct: M, inverse: M)
          res    <- colToVec(colRes)
        } yield res

      override def compose(first: AT, second: AT): ZIO[Any, AlgebraicError, AT] =
        for {
          direct  <- matrixModule.mul(second.direct, first.direct)
          inverse <- matrixModule.mul(first.inverse, second.inverse)
        } yield AT(direct, inverse)
    }
  }
```
- Dependency on `MatrixModule`

- capability accessor method
- unit tests
- functional testing
- functional mocking
- macros
- add layers to the onion

Plan for the talk
^ Top down approach. Start from the camera, raster, render on canvas
Continue with how to produce the ray for the pixel and the color for the ray
Delegate the color computation to the World module
Live world module can rely further on Phong, LightReflection, Refraction etc...

---
# Functional Effects
^ Now let's consider another function, that given a matrix, inverts it

FP: Programming with values and functions

```scala
def invert(m: Matrix): Matrix = ???

val m = Matrix( 
    1, 2, 
    1, 2
)

invert(m) // Exception!
```

This function is not total. How do we deal with that?

## Preparing slides for your class doesnâ€™t have to be an endless chore.
## Here are a few Deckset features that will help you get the most out of your slides.

---

# Footers and Slide Numbers

Include persistent custom footers and/or running slide numbers by using directives:

```
footer: Â© Unsigned Integer UG, 2017
slidenumbers: true
```

Make sure the two directives start on the *first line* of your markdown file, and ensure there are *no empty lines* between the two.

---

# Footnotes

Manage your footnotes[^] directly where you need them. Alongside numbers, you can also use text references[^Sample Footnote].

Include footnotes by inserting`[^Your Footnote]` within the text. The accompanying reference can appear anywhere in the document:

`[^Your Footnote]: Full reference here`

[^2]: This is the first footnote reference

[^Sample Footnote]: This is the second footnote reference

---

# Footnotes

Footnote references need to be *unique in the markdown file*. This means, that you can also reference footnotes from any slide, no matter where they are defined.

When there are multiple references are listed, they must all be separated by blanks lines.

---


# Nested Lists

- You can create nested lists
    1. by indenting
    1. each item with
    1. 4 spaces
- Itâ€™s that simple

---

# Links

Create links to any external resourceâ€”like [a website](http://www.deckset.com)â€”by wrapping link text in square brackets, followed immediately by a set of regular parentheses containing the URL where you want the link to point:

`â€˜[a website](http://www.deckset.com)â€™`

Your links will be clickable in exported PDFs as well!

---

# Display formulas

Easily include mathematical formulas by enclosing TeX commands in `$$` delimiters. Deckset uses [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) to translate TeX commands into beautiful vector graphics.

<a name="formulas"></a>

## SchrÃ¶dinger equation

The simplest way to write the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation is $$H\psi = E\psi$$, however, with the Hamiltonian operator expanded it becomes:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + V\psi = E\psi
$$

---

# Captioned Images and Videos

![inline](room.jpg)

Easily create captions using [inline] images/videos with text underneath.

---

# Plus:

- PDF export for printed handouts
- Speaker notes and rehearsal mode
- Switch theme and ratio on the fly
- Animated GIFs for cheap wins and LOLs :-)
